{"name":"sncosmo","tagline":"A Python Library for Supernova Cosmology","body":"SNCosmo is a pure-Python library for simulating, fitting and typing supernova light curves, built on NumPy, SciPy and AstroPy.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nGenerate observed photometric data from a light curve model:\r\n```python\r\n>>> import sncosmo\r\n>>> model = sncosmo.get_obsmodel('salt2')\r\n>>> model.set(x0=1.e-7, x1=0.5, c=0.05, z=1.0, t0=55100.)\r\n>>> model.bandmag('sdssr', 'ab', times=[55075., 55100., 55140.])\r\narray([ 27.1180182 ,  25.68243714,  28.28456537])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nAssuming you have astropy installed:\r\n```\r\n$ pip install sncosmo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](http://sncosmo.readthedocs.org) contains more details on installing and using the package.\r\n\r\nTo report bugs and request features, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sncosmo/sncosmo/issues). To contact me directly, please use kylebarbary [at] gmail dot com.\r\n\r\nWe are developing this package for use with Dark Energy Survey, but it is designed to be generally useful for supernova analysis. We welcome comments and contributions.
